  <span class="chapter-name">Preface to the Fourth Edition</span></h1>

  <p id="N10077">When Dave asked me to join as a coauthor of the third edition of this book, I was thrilled. After all, it was from the first printing of the first edition of this book that I had learned Rails. Dave and I also have much in common. Although he prefers Emacs and Mac OS X and my preferences tend toward Vim and Ubuntu, we both share a love for the command line and getting our fingers dirty with code&mdash;starting with tangible examples before diving into heavy theory.</p>

  <p id="N1007A">Since the time the third edition was published (and, in fact, since the first, second, and third editions), much has changed. Rails is in the process of being significantly refactored, mostly internally. A number of features that were used in previous examples have been initially deprecated and subsequently removed. New features have been added, and much experience has been obtained as to what the best practices are for using Rails. Rails now also works on Ruby 1.9, and each of the examples has been tested with Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2.</p>

  <p id="N1007D">Additionally, Rails has exploded from being a popular framework to an active and vibrant ecosystem, complete with many popular plugins and deep integration into third-party tools. In the process, Rails has become mainstream, attracting a more diverse set of developers to the framework.</p>

  <p id="N10080">This has led to a reorganization of the book. Many newcomers to Rails have not had the pleasure of being introduced to Ruby, so this section has been promoted from an appendix to a chapter in Part I. We follow Part I with a step-by-step walk-through of building a real application, which has been updated and streamlined to focus on current best practices.</p>

  <p id="N10083">But the biggest change is in the final part: because it is no longer practical to cover the entire ecosystem of Rails given both its breadth and rate of change, this part is now focused on providing an overall perspective of the landscape, enabling you, the reader, to know what to look for and where to find plugins and related tools to address common needs that go far beyond what the framework itself contains.</p>

  <p id="N10086">In short, this book needed to adapt. Once again.</p>
