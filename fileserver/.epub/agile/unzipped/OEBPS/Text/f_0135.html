        <p id="N1F181">XML and HTML templates,</p>

  <p id="N1F190">At this point, we have covered base Rails itself. But there is much more to the story. Much of what makes Rails great is functionality provided by components that Rails builds upon.</p>

  <p id="N1F193">These components should be familiar, because you have used each one. Atom templates, HTML templates, <code class="cf ic">rake db:migrate</code>, <code class="cf ic">bundle install</code>, and <code class="cf ic">rails server</code> should all be familiar by now.</p>

  <p id="N1F19F">Although this chapter goes beyond your normal day-to-day activities and shows how each component can be used in isolation, it is not meant to be an exhaustive description of any of these components. Each component requires a small book in itself to do it justice. Instead, the intent of this chapter is to introduce you to a number of key components in order to provide the background necessary for you to begin self-directed explorations.</p>

  <p id="N1F1A2">We start by introducing you to a number of such dependencies, beginning with the underlying templating engines that power views. Then we will explore <span class="emph">Bundler</span>, which is the component that is used to manage dependencies. Finally, we will show how these pieces are put together using Rack and Rake.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
