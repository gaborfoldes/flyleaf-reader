  <h2 id="heading_id_2">1.1 Installing on Windows</h2>

  <p id="N10371">The easiest way to install Rails on Windows is by using the the RailsInstaller<a href="../Text/f_0020.html#FOOTNOTE-7" id="FNPTR-7">[7]</a> package. Just be sure that you are using version 2.0, which includes Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.1. At the time of this writing, RailsInstaller 2.0 is only available as a Preview Release and appears at the bottom of the page. Feel free to use the Preview Release until the Final Release is available.</p>

  <p id="N1038E">Base installation is a snap. After you download, click Run, then click Next. Select “I accept the License” (after reading it carefully of course), click Next, Install, and Finish.</p>

  <p id="N10391">This opens a command window and prompts you for your name and email. This is only to set up the <span class="emph">git</span> version control system. For the purposes of the exercises in this book, you won’t need to worry about the <span class="emph">ssh</span> key that is generated.</p>

  <p id="N1039A">Close this window and open a new command prompt by selecting the Windows Start, Run..., enter <code class="cf ic">cmd</code>, and click OK.</p>

  <p id="N103A0">OK, you Windows users are done. You can skip forward to Section 1.4, <a href="../Text/f_0017.html#sec.rails.versions">​<em>Choosing a Rails Version</em>​</a>. See you there.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
