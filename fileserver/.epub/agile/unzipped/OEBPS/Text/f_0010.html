  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Who This Book Is For</h2>

  <p id="N1020B">This book is for programmers looking to build and deploy web-based applications. This includes application programmers who are new to Rails (and perhaps even new to Ruby) and ones who are familiar with the basics but want a more in-depth understanding of Rails.</p>

  <p id="N1020E">We presume some familiarity with HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, in other words, the ability to view source on web pages. You do not need to be an expert on these subjects; the most you will ever be expected to do is to copy and paste material from the book, all of which can be downloaded.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
