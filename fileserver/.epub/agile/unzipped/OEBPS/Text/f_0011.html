  <h2 id="heading_id_2">How To Read This Book</h2>

  <p id="N10215">The first part of this book makes sure you are ready. By the time you are done with it, you will have been introduced to Ruby (the language), you will have been exposed to an overview of Rails itself, you will have both Ruby and Rails installed, and you will have verified this installation with a simple example.</p>

  <p id="N10218">The next part takes you through the concepts behind Rails via an extended example; we build a simple online store. It doesn’t take you one by one through each component of Rails (“here is a chapter on models, here is a chapter on views,” and so forth). These components are designed to work together, and each chapter in this section tackles a specific set of related tasks that involve a number of these components working together.</p>

  <p id="N1021B">Most folks seem to enjoy building the application along with the book. If you don’t want to do all that typing, you can cheat and download the source code (a compressed tar archive or a zip file).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3" id="FNPTR-3">[3]</a> This download contains separate sets of source code for Rails 3.0 and Rails 3.1. The files you will want will be in a <code class="cf filename">rails31</code> directory. See the <code class="cf filename">README-FIRST</code> file for more details.</p>

  <p id="N1022B">The third part of the book, starting <a href="../Text/f_0098.html#part.in.depth">​here​</a>, surveys the entire Rails ecosystem. This starts with the functions and facilities of Rails that you will now be familiar with. It then covers a number of key dependencies that the Rails framework makes use of that contribute directly to the overall functionality that the Rails framework delivers. Finally, there is a survey of a number of popular plugins that augment the Rails framework and make Rails an open ecosystem rather than merely a framework.</p>

  <p id="N10231">Along the way, you’ll see various conventions we’ve adopted.</p>

      <p id="N1026B">This contains the path to the code within the download. If you’re reading the ebook version of this book and your ebook viewer supports hyperlinks, you can click the bar, and the code should appear in a browser window. Some browsers (such as Safari) will mistakenly try to interpret some of the templates as HTML. If this happens, view the source of the page to see the real source code.</p>

      <p id="N1026E">And in some cases involving the modification of an existing file where the lines to be changed may not be immediately obvious, you will also see some helpful little triangles on the left of the lines that you will need to change. Two such lines are indicated in the previous code.</p>

      <p id="N10277">Although you need to know Ruby to write Rails applications, we realize that many folks reading this book will be learning both Ruby and Rails at the same time. You will find a (very) brief introduction to the Ruby language in Chapter 4, <a href="../Text/f_0030.html#chp.ruby.basics">​<em>Introduction to Ruby</em>​</a>. When we use a Ruby-specific construct for the first time, we’ll cross-reference it to that chapter. For example, this paragraph contains a gratuitous use of <code class="cf ic">:name</code>, a Ruby symbol. In the margin, you’ll see an indication that symbols are explained <a href="../Text/f_0031.html#wtf.symbol">​here​</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="force-newline"><span class="emph">David Says…</span></dt>

    <dd>
      <p id="N1028D">Every now and then you’ll come across a <span class="emph">David Says…</span> sidebar. Here’s where David Heinemeier Hansson gives you the real scoop on some particular aspect of Rails&mdash;rationales, tricks, recommendations, and more. Because he’s the fellow who invented Rails, these are the sections to read if you want to become a Rails pro.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="force-newline"><span class="emph">Joe Asks…</span></dt>

    <dd>
      <p id="N10299">Joe, the mythical developer, sometimes pops up to ask questions about stuff we talk about in the text. We answer these questions as we go along.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p id="N1029D">This book isn’t meant to be a reference manual for Rails. Our experience is that reference manuals are not the way most people learn. Instead, we show most of the modules and many of their methods, either by example or narratively in the text, in the context of how these components are used and how they fit together.</p>

  <p id="N102A0">Nor do we have hundreds of pages of API listings. There’s a good reason for this&mdash;you get that documentation whenever you install Rails, and it’s guaranteed to be more up-to-date than the material in this book. If you install Rails using RubyGems (which we recommend), simply start the gem documentation server (using the command <code class="cf commandname">gem server</code>), and you can access all the Rails APIs by pointing your browser at <code class="cf ic">http://localhost:8808</code>. You will find out <a href="../Text/f_0100.html#p.rake.doc">​here​</a> how to build even more documentation and guides.</p>

  <p id="N102C1">In addition, you will see that Rails itself helps you by producing responses that clearly identify any error found, as well as traces that tell you not only what point the error was found but how you got there. You can see an example in Figure 16, <a href="../Text/f_0063.html#fig.depot.g.exception">​<em>Our application spills its guts.</em>​</a>. If you need additional information, peek ahead to Section 10.2, <a href="../Text/f_0063.html#sec.handling.errors">​<em>Iteration E2: Handling Errors</em>​</a> to see how to insert logging statements.</p>

  <p id="para.online.resources">Should you get really stuck, there are plenty of online resources to help. In addition to the code listings mentioned, there is a forum,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4" id="FNPTR-4">[4]</a> where you can ask questions and share experiences; an errata page,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5" id="FNPTR-5">[5]</a> where you can report bugs; and a wiki,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-6" id="FNPTR-6">[6]</a> where you can discuss the exercises found throughout the book.</p>

  <p id="N102E0">These resources are shared resources. Feel free to post not only questions and problems to the forum and wiki but also any suggestions and answers that you may have to questions others may have posted.</p>

  <p id="N102E3">Let’s get started! The first steps are to install Ruby and Rails and to verify the installation with a simple demonstration.</p>
