  <p id="N1FA58">Since the beginning of this book, we’ve talked incessantly about convention over configuration in that Rails has sensible defaults for just about everything. And more recently in the book, we’ve described Rails in terms of the underlying gems that you get when you install Rails. Now it is time to put those two thoughts together and reveal that the initial set of gems that Rails provides you is, itself, a sensible set of defaults&mdash;ones that you can both add to and change.</p>

Instead of describing this in the abstract, we will select a few plugins and use them to illustrate different aspects of how plugins are installed and what plugins can do. The fact that many of these plugins turn out to be immediately useful for your day-to-day work is simply a bonus!</p>
