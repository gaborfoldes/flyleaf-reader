      <p id="N173C8">The short answer is no. In fact, many Rails applications are for a small or homogeneous group and never need translating. That being said, pretty much everybody that does find that they need translation agrees that it is best if this is done early. So, unless you are sure that translation will not ever be needed, it is our recommendation that you at least understand what would be involved so that you can make an informed decision.</p>

  <p id="N173CB">Now we have a basic cart working, and our customer starts to inquire about languages other than English, noting that her company has a big push on for expansion in emerging markets. Unless we can present something in a language that visitors to our customer’s website will understand, our customer will be leaving money on the table. We can’t have that.</p>

  <p id="N173CE">The first problem is that none of us is a professional translator. The customer reassures us that this is not something that we need to concern ourselves with because that part of the effort will be outsourced. All we need to worry about is <span class="emph">enabling</span> translation. Furthermore, we don’t have to worry about the administration pages just yet, because all the administrators speak English. What we have to focus on is the store.</p>

  <p id="N173D4">That’s a relief&mdash;but is still a tall order. We are going to need to define a way to enable the user to select a language, we are going to have to provide the translations themselves, and we are going to have to change the views to use these translations. But we are up to the task, and armed with a bit of memory of high-school Spanish, we set off to work.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
