  <p id="N11CB8">So, after sitting down with the customer and doing some preliminary analysis, we’re ready to start using a computer for development! We’ll be working from our original three diagrams, but the chances are pretty good that we’ll be throwing them away fairly quickly&mdash;they’ll become outdated as we gather feedback. Interestingly, that’s why we didn’t spend too long on them; it’s easier to throw something away if you didn’t spend a long time creating it.</p>

  <p id="N11CCE">In the chapters that follow, we’ll start developing the application based on our current understanding. However, before we turn that page, we have to answer just one more question: what should we do first?</p>

  <p id="N11CD1">We like to work with the customer so we can jointly agree on priorities. In this case, we’d point out to her that it’s hard to develop anything else until we have some basic products defined in the system, so we suggest spending a couple of hours getting the initial version of the product maintenance functionality up and running. And, of course, the client would agree.</p>
