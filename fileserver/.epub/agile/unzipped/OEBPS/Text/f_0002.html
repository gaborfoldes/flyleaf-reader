      <p id="N10042">When I started learning Ruby on Rails, I read the first edition of this book. Its holistic view of the Rails framework and community provides any new developer the kick start they need to a highly successful career. After reading through the latest edition cover to cover, I can happily say that it continues that trend and remains the first book I recommend to any new Rails developer.</p>

      <p id="N1004E"><span class="booksectname">Agile Web Development with Rails</span> does an excellent job of making the Rails environment accessible in an enjoyable and memorable way. In addition, this book is the first I’ve seen that provides a sensible and coherent explanation of the MVC pattern, and it does so in a natural progression using examples that completely remove any mystery.</p>
