    <ul>
      <li>
        <p id="N102F7">installing Ruby, RubyGems, SQLite3, and Rails; and</p>
      </li>

      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p id="N102FE">In Part I of this book, we’ll introduce you to both the Ruby language and the Rails framework. But we can’t get anywhere until you’ve installed both and verified that they are operating correctly.</p>

  <p id="N10301">To get Rails running on your system, you’ll need the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p id="N10307">A Ruby interpreter. Rails is written in Ruby, and you’ll be writing your applications in Ruby too. Rails 3.1 requires Ruby version 1.9.2 or Ruby 1.8.7. It is known not to work on Ruby versions 1.8.6 and Ruby 1.9.1.</p>

      <p id="N1030A">The differences between versions of Ruby that affect this book are described in the sidebar <a href="#sb.ruby.version">​here​</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N10311">The Ruby packaging system, namely, RubyGems. This edition is based on RubyGems version 1.8.6.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N10315">Ruby on Rails. This book was written using Rails version 3.1 (specifically Rails 3.1.0 at the current time).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N10319">A JavaScript interpreter. Both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X have JavaScript interpreters built in, and Rails will use the version already on your system. On other operating systems, you may need to install a JavaScript interpreter separately.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N1031D">Some libraries, depending on the operating system.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N10321">A database. We’re using both SQLite 3 and MySQL 5.1 in this book.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <div class="sidebar-content">
      <p id="N10328">This book is based on Ruby 1.9.2.</p>

      <p id="N1032B">While Rails 3.1 works with either Ruby 1.8.7 or Ruby 1.9.2, the Rails core team recommends Ruby 1.9.2 for all new Rails applications. Ruby 1.9.2 has improved syntax and performance. Furthermore, support for Ruby 1.8.7 is expected to be dropped in Rails 4.0.</p>

      <p id="N1032E">Should you decide to install or stick with Ruby 1.8.7 instead, some of the generated scaffolding will use the “old style” hash syntax. Here’s an example of the “new style” hash syntax:</p>

      <table class="processedcode">
        <tr>
          <td class="codeprefix">&nbsp;</td>

          <td class="codeline"><code class="sgc-1">redirect_to @cart, notice: <em class="string">'Cart was successfully created.'</em></code></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p id="N1033E">Here’s what Rails 3.1 will generate instead if you are using Ruby 1.8.7:</p>

      <table class="processedcode">
        <tr>
          <td class="codeprefix">&nbsp;</td>

          <td class="codeline"><code class="sgc-1">redirect_to @cart, :notice =&gt; <em class="string">'Cart was successfully created.'</em></code></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p id="N1034E">Note that the position of the <span class="emph">colon</span> character changed and the addition of an arrow formed using an equals sign and a greater-than sign.</p>

      <p id="N10354">The other change that you will need to be aware of is that the format of the output of tests has changed.</p>

      <p id="N10357">If you keep these two factors in mind, you can use this book to learn Rails 3.1 using Ruby 1.8.7.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p id="N1035A">For a development machine, that’s about all you’ll need (apart from an editor, and we’ll talk about editors separately). However, if you are going to deploy your application, you will also need to install a production web server (as a minimum) along with some support code to let Rails run efficiently. We have a whole chapter devoted to this, starting <a href="../Text/f_0091.html#chp.deployment">​here​</a>, so we won’t talk about it more here.</p>

  <p id="N10360">So, how do you get all this installed? It depends on your operating system...</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
