  <p id="N15F1E">At this point, we have a website that will respond to requests and will provide feeds that allow sales of individual titles to be checked on periodically. At times it makes sense to have something more than that. For those times, what we need is the ability to actively target a message to somebody specific when an event occurs. It could be wanting to notify a system administrator when an exception occurs. It could be a user feedback form. In this chapter, we will opt to simply send confirmation emails to people who have placed orders. Once we complete that, we will create tests not only for the mail support that we just added but for the entire user scenario we have created so far.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
