  <p id="N1E9E1">Previous chapters focused primarily on server-to-human communications, mostly via HTML. But not all web interactions need to directly involve a person. This chapter focuses accessing your Rails application and data from within a stand-alone script.</p>

  <p id="N1E9F1">There are a variety of reasons why you might want to access portions of your Rails application from outside a browser. For example, you may desire to have your database loaded or synchronized periodically using a background job kicked off by a utility like <code class="cf ic">cron</code>. You may have existing applications, perhaps even Rails applications, that want to directly access the data in (another) Rails application, possibly even on a different machine. You might just want a command-line interface, not because it is required but just because.</p>

  <p id="N1E9F7">Whatever your reasons, Rails is there for you. As you will see, you will be able to pull in as little or as much of Rails as you need to get your job done.</p>

  <p id="N1E9FA">We will start with the assumption that your application is on the same machine as your installation of Rails and your data, and then we will proceed to describing how you can do the same things on a remote machine.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
