  <p id="N12E0C">All in all, it’s been a successful set of iterations. We gathered the initial requirements from our customer, documented a basic flow, worked out a first pass at the data we’ll need, and put together the maintenance page for the Depot application’s products. It hasn’t even taken many lines of code. We even have a small but growing test suite.</p>

  <p id="N12E0F">Thus emboldened, it’s on to our next task. We chatted about priorities with our customer, and she said she’d like to start seeing what the application looks like from the buyer’s point of view. Our next task is to create a simple catalog display.</p>

  <p id="N12E12">This also makes a lot of sense from our point of view. Once we have the products safely tucked into the database, it should be fairly simple to display them. It also gives us a basis from which to develop the shopping cart portion of the code later.</p>

  <p id="N12E15">We should also be able to draw on the work we just did in the product maintenance task&mdash;the catalog display is really just a glorified product listing.</p>

  <p id="N12E18">Finally, we will also need to complement our unit tests for the model with some functional tests for the controller.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
