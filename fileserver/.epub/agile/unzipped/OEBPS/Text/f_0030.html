  <p id="N11090">Many people who are new to Rails are also new to Ruby. If you are familiar with a language such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, or Python, you will find Ruby pretty easy to pick up.</p>

  <p id="N11093">This chapter is not a complete introduction to Ruby. It will not cover topics such as precedence rules (like most other programming languages, 1+2*3==7 in Ruby). It is only meant to explain enough Ruby that the examples in the book make sense.</p>

  <p id="N11096">This chapter draws heavily from material in Chapter 2 of <em>Programming Ruby</em>&nbsp;[TFH08]. If you think you need more background on the Ruby language, and at the risk of being grossly self-serving, we’d like to suggest that the best way to learn Ruby, and the best reference for Ruby’s classes, modules, and libraries, is <em>Programming Ruby</em>&nbsp;[TFH08] (also known as the PickAxe book).
