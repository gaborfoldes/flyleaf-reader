  <p id="N10100">You’d think that producing a new edition of a book would be easy. After all, you already have all the text. It’s just a tweak to some code here and a minor wording change there, and you’re done. You’d think….</p>

  <p id="N10103">It’s difficult to tell exactly, but our impression is that creating each edition of <em>Agile Web Development with Rails</em> took about as much effort as the first edition. Rails is constantly evolving and, as it does, so has this book. Parts of the Depot application were rewritten several times, and all of the narrative was updated. The emphasis on REST and the avoidance of features as they become deprecated have repeatedly changed the structure of the book as what was once hot became just lukewarm.</p>

  <p id="N10109">So, this book would not exist without a massive amount of help from the Ruby and Rails communities. To start with, we had a number of incredibly helpful formal reviewers of drafts of this book:</p>

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <p id="N10111">Jeremy&nbsp;Anderson, Ken&nbsp;Coar, Jeff&nbsp;Cohen, Joel&nbsp;Clermont, Geoff&nbsp;Drake, Pavan&nbsp;Gorakavi, Michael&nbsp;Jurewitz, Mikel&nbsp;Lindsaar, Paul&nbsp;Rayner, Martijn&nbsp;Reuvers, Doug&nbsp;Rhoten, Gary&nbsp;Sherman, Davanum&nbsp;Srinivas, Stefan&nbsp;Turalski, and José&nbsp;Valim</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p id="N10114">Additionally, each edition of this book has been released as a beta book: early versions were posted as PDFs, and people made comments online. And comment they did: more than 800 suggestions and bug reports were posted for this edition alone. The vast majority ended up being incorporated, making this book immeasurably more useful than it would have been. While thanks go out to all for supporting the beta book program and for contributing so much valuable feedback, a number of contributors went well beyond the call of duty:</p>

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <p id="N1011C">Manuel&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Vidaurre&nbsp;Arenas, Seth&nbsp;Arnold, Will&nbsp;Bowlin, Andy&nbsp;Brice, Jason&nbsp;Catena, Victor&nbsp;Marius&nbsp;Costan, David&nbsp;Hadley, Jason&nbsp;Holloway, David&nbsp;Kapp, Trung&nbsp;LE, Kristian&nbsp;Riiber&nbsp;Mandrup, mltsy, Steve&nbsp;Nicholson, Jim&nbsp;Puls, Johnathan&nbsp;Ritzi, Leonel&nbsp;S, Kim&nbsp;Shrier, Don&nbsp;Smith, Joe&nbsp;Straitiff, and Martin&nbsp;Zoller</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p id="N1011F">Finally, the Rails core team has been incredibly helpful, answering questions, checking out code fragments, and fixing bugs. A big “thank you” to the following:</p>
