  <h2 id="sec.rails.versions">1.4 Choosing a Rails Version</h2>

  <p id="N10592">The previous instructions helped you install the latest version of Rails. But occasionally you might not want to run the latest version. For example, you might want to run the version of Rails that matches this version used to develop this book so that you can be absolutely confident that the output and examples exactly match. Or perhaps you are developing on one machine but intending to deploy on another machine that contains a version of Rails that you don’t have any control over.</p>

  <p id="N1059A">If either of these situations applies to you, you need to be aware of a few things. For starters, you can find out all the versions of Rails you have installed using the <code class="cf commandname">gem</code> command:</p>

  <table class="processedcode">
    <tr>
      <td class="codeprefix">&nbsp;</td>

      <td class="codeline"><code class="sgc-1">$ <strong class="prompt">gem list --local rails</strong></code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p id="N105AE">You can also verify what version of Rails you are running as the default by using the <code class="cf commandname">rails --version</code> command. It should return 3.1.0 or newer.</p>

  <p id="N105B4">Installing another version of Rails is also done via the <code class="cf ic">gem</code> command. Depending on your operating system, you might need to preface the command with <code class="cf ic">sudo</code>.</p>

  <table class="processedcode">
    <tr>
      <td class="codeprefix">&nbsp;</td>

      <td class="codeline"><code class="sgc-1">$ <strong class="prompt">gem install rails --version 3.1.0</strong></code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p id="N105CB">Now, having multiple versions of Rails wouldn’t do anybody any good unless there were a way to pick one. As luck would have it, there is. On any <code class="cf commandname">rails</code> command, you can control which version of Rails is used by inserting the full version number surrounded by underscores before the first parameter of the command:</p>

  <table class="processedcode">
    <tr>
      <td class="codeprefix">&nbsp;</td>

      <td class="codeline"><code class="sgc-1">$ <strong class="prompt">rails _3.1.0_ --version</strong></code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p id="N105DF">This is particularly handy when you create a new application, because once you create an application with a specific version of Rails, it will continue to use that version of Rails&mdash;even if newer versions are installed on the system&mdash;until <span class="emph">you</span> decide it is time to upgrade. To upgrade, simply update the version number in the <code class="cf filename">Gemfile</code> that is in the root directory of your application, and run <code class="cf ic">bundle install</code>. We will cover this command in greater depth <a href="../Text/f_0138.html#sec.bundler">​here​</a>.</p><script src="../Misc/book_local.js" type="text/javascript">
