  <span class="chapter-name">Preface to the Rails 3.1 Version of This Book</span></h1>

  <p id="N10094">This book is written for Rails 3.1.</p>

  <p id="N10097">The Rails core team is continuing to work on Rails. From time to time, new releases may introduce incompatibilities for applications written for prior versions of Rails, including the code in this book.</p>

  <p id="N1009A">To run the examples provided in this book, it is important that you install the correct version of Rails, as described in Chapter 1, <a href="../Text/f_0013.html#chp.installing">​<em>Installing Rails</em>​</a></p>

  <p id="N1009F">To determine the version of Rails that you are running, you can issue <code class="cf ic">rails -v</code> at a command prompt.</p>

  <p id="N100A5">Information on changes to Rails that affect this book can be found at <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/wikis/wiki/ChangesToRails">http://www.pragprog.com/wikis/wiki/ChangesToRails</a>.</p>

  <p id="N100AB">Even though Rails 3.1 is purportedly only a <span class="emph">minor</span> release and includes few major internal changes (certainly as compared to the changes made between Rails 2.3.x and Rails 3.0), it contains a significant number of user-facing changes that affect this book. As such, the Pragmatic Bookshelf team decided to update this book to reflect these changes.</p>

  <p id="N100B1">Here’s an overview of some of the bigger changes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p id="N100B7">Generated code is aware of which version of Ruby you are using. It will take advantage of the new and cleaner hash value syntax available in Ruby 1.9.2, and will also format the output of tests differently.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100BB">Asset management is now a core part of Rails. This changes where you place a number of files, and adds a step to deployment.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100BF">SCSS is available by default, which changes both the syntax and the organization of all of the stylesheets.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100C3">JQuery replaces Prototype and Script.aculo.us, changing the JavaScript code that you will write in Chapter 11, <a href="../Text/f_0065.html#chp.ajax.cart">​<em>Task F: Add a Dash of Ajax</em>​</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100CA">CoffeeScript is available by default, which changes the syntax of client-side scripts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100CE">Migration methods are no longer class methods, and in most cases are automatically reversible.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100D2">Default serialization of responses is now JSON instead of XML. There also is a handy new <code class="cf ic">j</code> view helper that makes producing JSON (and JavaScript in general) responses easier.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100D9">A <code class="cf ic">has_secure_password</code> method has been added to the model, which encapsulates and standardizes common user password hashing logic.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100E0"><code class="cf ic">Rack::Cache</code> is enabled by default in production.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="N100E6">The <code class="cf ic">mysql2</code> gem replaces <code class="cf ic">mysql</code> gem.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
